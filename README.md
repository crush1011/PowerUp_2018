## Rules for program

2) All methods MUST contain a header comment with the primary author and all contributors as well as a description of the method, parameters, and the return value.
3) Make all changes in a branch OTHER than Master. Once a part of the code is done and ready to be reviewed for use in the Master make a pull request. From there only select individuals can approve the changes, and they should be added as reviewers in Github.
